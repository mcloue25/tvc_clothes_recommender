# tvc_clothes_recommender
This repo will contain all of the code used to create the dataset I will use to try build a singl class classification model using images downloaded from https://wearetvc.com/


# Update 14/11/2022:
Just over 7.5k images have been collected. 
Initial model testing showed signs of overfitting. 
Began working on dataset_analysis.py to get deeper insights into class distribution & other potnetial factors.
As part of this I have to rename all of the unnamed rows that I didnt account for while scraping.
Created basic clothes type prediction model using a version of the keras fashion_mnist dataset created in clothes_detection.py
Now to finish renaming process and clean up analysis process.
Will then form plan of attack once I have a thorough report on where I'm at.
